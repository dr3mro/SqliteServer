# üöÄ PROJECT VALHALLA

 - Before testing make sure you clean all the old containers.
 - cd into $PROJECT_DIR/docker and run those commands
```
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
docker compose up --build
```

### üß™ Verify the server is running

```
curl http://172.20.0.2:8080/v1/hello
```
- if you get this reply `Welcome to ASGARD.%` that means the server is up and running
### üö¶ Resource not found
- if for any reason the server did not find the requested end point it will display this message

```
NOT FOUND, Are you lost?%
```


### üéâ Create a new User
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @user.json http://172.20.0.2:8080/v1/user -i
```
- do a POST request on `/v1/user` with a body contains a JSON with following data
```
{
  "payload": {
    "fullname": "Amr Nasr",
    "username": "amr_nasr",
    "password": "123Mm@p0",

}%
```
- the "payload" value is verified on the server against SHA256SUM that should be generated and added to the JSON in sha256sum key.
- in the next updates there would be an `api_key` for creating users and should be supplied with every registeration but for now its not being used, currently "payload" "sha256sum" are the only needed.
- in the "payload" the username should only composed of lower case characters and numbers and not start with number and does not contains white spaces.
- the password should contains upper and lower case characters, symbols, numbers and at lest 8 characters long.
- the email should be in a valid format user@domain.ext
- the role value is for now '0' as the role implementation is WIP.

### üö™ Login
```
 curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @login.json http://172.20.0.2:8080/v1/user -i

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @patient.json http://172.20.0.2:8080/v1/patient -i
```
- In order to add a new user do a POST request in `/v1/patient` with a body contains JSON like this.
```

}
```
- The payload should contain 3 item:
  * "basic_data"
  * "appointments_data"
  * "health_data"
- The basic_data should contains {"id" = 0}.
- Providing empty value '{}' will clear the corresponding field in the database.
- Not providing a key for example "health_data" has no effect as only the provided data is processed.
- The payload should be verified with sha256sum and the hash should be provided in the JSON as "sha256sum" value.
- The username should exists and be valid.
- The access token should be valid.
- A successful request will return the user_id and it looks like this.

- the access token should be valid.
- the username should be valid.
- the 'id' is the patient_id and should exists

}
```
 - explanation:

    * keyword: the text to search for in basic data
    * limit: maximum number of returned results
    * offset : start with 0 and keep it to send it in the next request to get the next patch
    * order_by : name of json key to sort by
    * direction : ascending = 0 , descending = 1
    * user_name : of the user that is requesting the search
    * token : the valid token

- a reply would look like this
